# Howdy all!

This is a page for the game stuff I am making!

## 1: Deepstone (name in progress)

Requires: A python interpreter to run!

Summary: You awake and it's completely dark... what would you like to do?

This is a text adventure game that runs on python! I made it on visual studio code. Enjoy!
