# Sam's text adventure!

## What is this mysterious thing?

This is a game I made that I think I am gonna call Deepstone.
It's a text adventure I began working on as part of my final project for a intro to programming class I took.

## How?

A. Lot. Of. If. Then. Statements. Also a couple of lists.

## Timeline

From start until current time (Circa April 18th 2024 - now, April 29th 2024) will be very muddy as I lazily did not write any documentation as the project was going swimmingly well with little to no snags.

April 18th 2024 - April 29th 2024: Beginning of game created. Concept for Warl made, first bit of journey coded, created the first village and first three rows of houses with their "environments" and scenarios are coded. Fourth row currently in the making. Inventory system implemented, first few key items coded in. Obstacles list created, it's a mystery tool to help us later!
