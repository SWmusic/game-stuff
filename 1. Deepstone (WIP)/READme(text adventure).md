# Sam's text adventure!

## What is this mysterious thing?

This is a game I made that I think I am gonna call Deepstone.
It's a text adventure I began working on as part of my final project for a intro to programming class I took.

## What does the player need?

The player will need a python interpreter that can run the file. I personally use and recommend Visual Studio Code.

https://code.visualstudio.com/

There's a link ^^^

Once that is downloaded, you will open the app and go to extensions and download "Python". Now open the downloaded .py file and click the "run" arrow at the top. If you quit the game or wish to restart, first quit the game, and type clear in the terminal to erase the history of messages. Enjoy!

## How?

A. Lot. Of. If. Then. Statements. Also a couple of lists.

## Timeline

From start until current time (Circa April 18th 2024 - now, April 29th 2024) will be very muddy as I lazily did not write any documentation as the project was going swimmingly well with little to no snags.

April 18th, 2024 - April 29th, 2024: Beginning of game created. Concept for Warl made, first bit of journey coded, created the first village and first three rows of houses with their "environments" and scenarios are coded. Fourth row currently in the making. Inventory system implemented, first few key items coded in. Obstacles list created, it's a mystery tool to help us later!

April 30th, 2024: Foundation for fourth of row of houses made.
